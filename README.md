# Apartment-Price-Prediction

This project aims to use data taken from a real estate website in Romania to gain useful insights. Eventually, after proper cleaning, the same data is going to be used for the creation of an algorithm that predicts the future prices of apartments in Bucharest. The ability to make predictions will be in the form of a website.
